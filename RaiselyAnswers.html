<h2>Why would you be a good fit for the Customer Advocate Role?</h2>

<p>I would be a good fit for the Customer Advocate role for the following reasons:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li> I am currently working on my own socially minded company, called The Social Change (in my freetime), that is focused on data collection, MOOC courses and resources in the developing world. Thus, I feel a strong connection with the mission of Raisely and its focus on its social impact before anything else.</li>
    <li> To the point above, I am extreme go-getter. When I see opportunities that are not taken advantage of (no matter how crazy they may seem), my passion drives me to investigate, research and see if there are any solutions or new markets within them. That is exactly how my co-founder and I came to work on The Social Change: we saw a need for international aid and development that would <i> lift individuals out of poverty through data analysis, training and education </i> rather than sticking with the status quo. Many other ideas I am working on (including a converted airplane that offers a mobile classroom, homeless sleeping pods based off of aircraft seats, $10 dollar computers) have been driven my this passion also.
    <li> I went to school for nonprofit administration, and have been working within the field for 3+ years, making me able to understand client needs, and be able to provide support and sales to that sector with ease.</li>
    <li> I have a deep understanding about how computers talk and work. I spend every moment I can working on learning new langugages (working on Pythhon and SQL right now), staying on top of industry trends, and designing new hardware for the developing world. I have worked with HTML and CSS for quite a bit of time, staring with courses in middle school! </li>
    <li> My patience and resiance has been developed through my work not only in the nonprofit industry (where funds dictate the speed of many nonprofits and their reach), but also throughout the tech and aviation industries, where dealing with large scale clients worldwide taught me how to be a listener over a speaker at times, and to have empathy when a client is moving slow, unclear and has a challenging situation. Using my knowledge to satisfy a customer is a very fullfilling thing to me.</li>
    <li> My communication and English skills are superb, as I am a fluent speaker that knows how to use industry language with customers. I know how nonprofits speak, which m
    <li> Passion comes before money for me. I believe that leaving a lasting impact on the world is much more fullfilling than having happiness through money. </li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Tasks I am excited by, want to learn , and do not want to do?</h2>
<p> All of the tasks in this <a href="https://gist.github.com/tommaitland/193b189f80d15309f4bfc475a3a7e81e">link</a> excite me, with none of them being ones that I do not want to do. That is how passionate and excited I am about the position, because the wide range of different tasks avaliable for me to work on. I am excited the most about the following tasks:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li><b>Writing a new support article on how to optimise your donation form </b>: This is where I wholeheartedly believe </li>
    <li><b>Work with developers to debug and resolve a product issue</b></li>
    <li> </li>
</ul>
    Having said that, I would like to learn more about Importing data into a new Kepla account, as that is something that is a bit new to me.
