<h2>Why would you be a good fit for the Customer Advocate Role?</h2>

<p>I would be a good fit for the Customer Advocate role for the following reasons:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li> I am currently working on my own socially minded company, called The Social Change (in my freetime), that is focused on data collection, MOOC courses and resources in the developing world. Thus, I feel a strong connection with the mission of Raisely and its focus on its social impact before anything else.</li>
    <li> To the point above, I am extreme go-getter. When I see opportunities that are not taken advantage of (no matter how crazy they may seem), my passion drives me to investigate, research and see if there are any solutions or new markets within them. That is exactly how my co-founder and I came to work on The Social Change: we saw a need for international aid and development that would <i> lift individuals out of poverty through data analysis, training and education </i> rather than sticking with the status quo. Many other ideas I am working on (including a converted airplane that offers a mobile classroom, homeless sleeping pods based off of aircraft seats, $10 dollar computers) have been driven my passion also.
    <li> I went to school for nonprofit administration, and have been working within the field for 3+ years, making me able to understand client needs, and be able to provide support and sales to that sector with ease.</li>
    <li> I have a deep understanding about how computers talk and work. I spend every moment I can working on learning new langugages (working on Python and SQL right now), staying on top of industry trends, and designing new hardware for the developing world. I have worked with HTML and CSS for quite a bit of time, staring with courses in middle school! </li>
    <li> My patience and resiliance has been developed through my work not only in the nonprofit industry (where funds dictate the speed of many nonprofits and their reach), but also throughout the tech and aviation industries, where dealing with large scale clients worldwide taught me how to be a listener over a speaker at times, and to have empathy when a client is moving slow, unclear  or has a challenging situation. Using my knowledge to satisfy a customer is a very fullfilling thing to me.</li>
    <li> My communication and English skills are superb, as I am a fluent speaker that knows how to use industry language with customers. I know how nonprofits speak, which makes it easier for me to communicate and meet their needs. I am also able to speak to technical teams, and marketing and executive teams with ease.</li>
    <li> Passion comes before money for me. I believe that leaving a lasting impact on the world is much more fullfilling than having happiness through money. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Why do you want to work here over somewhere else? </h2>

<p> There are a three specific reasons as to why I would love to work for Raisely over any other company in the world:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li> The company´s set up and mission is extrremely appealing ot me, as I love working with nonprofit clients, and working for a company that puts its passion and mission ahead of it´s profit.</li>
    <li>The ability to work with worldwide clients is extremely appealing to me, as I enjoy interacting with customers from a variety of backgrounds, while trying to serve their needs and drive up more business to help more organizations throughout the world.</li>
    <li>For me personally, the software that Raisely offers is <i><u><b></b>extremely</i></u></b> beneficial to nonprofits. When I was working as a development coorinator and volunteer fundraising director for two nonprofits that were short on funds, I searched everywhere for a <i><b>free, flexible and easy to use</b></i> platform that would drive customer engagement and not hurt our conversion rate (one of our biggest struggles was moving donors from fundraising emails and letters to actually donating on our website or donations platform). The intergrations that Raisely offers are also extremely beneficial to nonprofits, as many use donor databases, analytical and marketing platforms that have such connections, making work easier for them. The software makes me extremely excited overall to say the least.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What are tasks you are excited by, want to learn , and do not want to do?</h2>

<p> All of the tasks in this <a href="https://gist.github.com/tommaitland/193b189f80d15309f4bfc475a3a7e81e">link</a> excite me, with none of them being ones that I do not want to do on a daily basis. That is how passionate and excited I am about the position, because the wide range of different tasks avaliable for me to work on. I am excited the most about the following tasks:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li><b>Writing a new support article on how to optimise your donation form </b>: This is where I wholeheartedly believe my skills will thrive, as I can create a easy to read, understand and trustworthy support article from the perspective of someone with not only a nonprofit fundraising background, but also a tech background. This will help to make it easier to understand, and hit all of the points a potential or current customer may need to seem in such an article.</li>
    <li><b>Work with developers to debug and resolve a product issue</b>: This is something I enjoyed doing while I was an aviation consultant. We worked with a Global Distribution System (GDS) called SABRE heavily. One of my duties was to report any bugs to the developers of the program, and work with them to fix them. We had a bug with passenger numbers between the Bahamas and Atlanta, to which I helped them with the code and data sources, in order to produce accurate numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having said that, I would like to learn more about Importing data into a new Kepla account, as that is something that is a bit new to me. I would also to keep working on my HTML and CSS skills further, which is something both personally and professionally I have been working on. </p>


<h2>Tell us about a company who does customer support well, and why you think they're good.</h2>

<p>There are actually a few companies that I believe have great customer service (from my interactions with them). Here are three of them in particular:

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li><b>jetBlue Airlines (USA):</b> When I was living in Chicago and traveling to Boston frequently (one of the jetBlue hubs), I never really had the chance to fly this airline until my fifth trip. I booked the ticket and realised that there was an error with my name on it. A quick tweet to their customer service page warrented a resolution, and I was happy enough to send them a tweet back asking if they gave away Pilots Wings on their flights (usually for kids but I was trying to disguise being for my cousin as I wanted them.) They sent me a friendly reply and made me feel welcome even though I was asking for random things. Their onboard service is also tailored to the customer- unlimited drinks, snacks and great In Flight Entertainment and WiFi, all served up with smiles. They are one of the only airlines I have flow that made me feel like a king rather than a statistic in their passengers. Taking this approach, especially in the United States, where aviation has become a race to the bottom,  is the best way to keep a customer. While I do not have a chance to fly them anymore (currently), their treatment of me made me want to fly them even if they are more expensive than other carriers. This goes to show how their approach of the customer first, profit next helps to retain their customers.</li>
    <li><b>Icelandair (Iceland)</b>: Icelandair is an airline based out of Iceland. While I have not had a chance to fly them, I had another Twitter interaction with them. I was seeing if they sold airline collectables (as I collect these and have it throughout my office - see this <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/I7kTEJCmdjcany1A3">link</a> for my collection!) They said they did not, but instead of giving me a textbook, dry reply to my query, they instead offered to send me a package for <i> free </i> from Iceland with some goodies in it. When the first package didn´t show up, they sent another one, again at <i> no cost </i> this approach to service, even though I wasn´t a paying customer, made me extremely happy and wanting to fly them at the first chance I got. That level of customer service, even though I wasn´t a paying customer, made me a convert and someone that would stand by their brand.</li>
</ul>
